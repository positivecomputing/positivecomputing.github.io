# <b> 3. Dataset </b>
<br/>

## <b>A dataset for the in-situ contexts where users perceive smartphone distractions</b> <a href = "https://github.com/Kaist-ICLab/positive-computing-dataset-distracting-context" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>
  * We collected in-situ user context and the corresponding smartphone distraction experiences. We implemented an mobile esm app that asks users to report their current contexts (i.e., their locations and activities) and to what extent they perceived smartphone distraction. During three weeks of the data collection session, we collected 9,180 ESM responses from 34 participants

## <b>A dataset for the in-situ contexts where users perceive smartphone distractions</b> <a href = "https://github.com/Ajou-HCI-Lab/MindScope" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:px35;height:35px;" ></a>
  * We extracted 29 features of the data from the Android smartphone application (MindScope). The data were collected from 36 participants for 27 days, four times a day. The features and data were used to predict stress levels.

## <b>User Status and Opportune Moment Dataset</b> <a href = "https://github.com/nmsl-kaist/mybutler-dataset" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>
  * This is a dataset about the opportuness of a smartphone user's status for interventions. In a one-week in-the-wild user study, 11 pairs of smartphone users used an app, called MyButler, in which each user can specify and share their current status with their partner. Their partner could choose whether to send a notification for their mobile instant message or not based on the shared status

# <b>4. Design Guidelines for Persuasive Interaction </b> <a href = "https://twkim24.notion.site/Design-guidelines-for-persuasive-interaction-service-system-design-abf585bbd2834ccbb2ce23c897514c72" ><img src="notion.png" alt="Notion Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:40px;height:40px;" ></a><br/>
  * Guidelines cover methods, practices, and examples for designing persuasive interactions. Our recommendations are based on the research result from the Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program
  * Guidelines consist of two parts: 1) Persuasive Interaction Design Guidelines for Stress Management 2) Guidelines for Persuasive Interaction Components and Experimentation. These guidelines may help design ICT services, test the effects of ICT services, or apply persuasive interaction components into ICT services
