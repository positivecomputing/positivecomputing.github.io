# <b> 1. Persuasive Interaction Software </b>
<br/>

## <b>EasyTrack</b> <a href = "https://github.com/Qobiljon/ET_Dashboard" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>
  * EasyTrack is an automated intelligent abnormal behavior and data quality issues detection platform in large-scale human studies.
  * This app provides data scalability, data quality management, abnormal behavior detection, data visualization, subject management tool, and researcher friendly UX/UI.

# <b> 2. Integrated Positive Computing Service System </b>
<br/>

## <b>Integrated Application</b> <a href = "https://github.com/alice-iceberg/Positive-Computing-Hub" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>

  * Link for APK <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_VCKXEMnD6TNwi1le5KSBGUek9X2CcEg" style ="color:#0097A7;">(Download)</a>
  * This app integrates the positive computing services developed through this project. 

      * <big><b>MindScope</b></big>
          * MindScope is an application that helps users to manage their daily stress level by predicting the userâ€™s stress level, showing it with three conditions (e.g., stress level low, little high and high) according to the collected data, and providing analysis on a daily basis. The stress prediction accuracy is further improved with the feedback from the users.  
      * <big><b>FocusAid</b></big>
          * FocusAid allows users to generate distraction management rules. Users can specify context conditions through this app where they perceive smartphones as distracting and designate actions to handle distraction in that condition.
      *  <big><b>GoldenTime</b></big>
          * GoldenTime is an app that promotes self-regulated usage behavior via system-driven proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives framed as gain or loss for behavioral reinforcement. System-driven timeboxing calculates the user's accumulated usage time per hour. If the usage time is less than 10 mins, the app provides users with incentives (i.e., micro-incentive) as a reward for phone regulation.
      *  <big><b>BeActive</b></big>
          * BeActive is a mobile health intervention app that aims to improve users' sedentary habits for long periods of time. The app provides users with JIT(Just-In-Time) alarm messages to promote a short break when their sedentary status lasts 50 minutes. If users follow the guide, the system gives them an incentive as a reward.
      * <big><b>MyButler</b></big>
          * MyButler is an app for a pair of Android users that aims to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. It allows a pair of users to privately share their status with one another and for the message sender to control the message notification based on the shared status of the other.
      * <big><b>RoutinAid</b></big>
          * RoutinAid is a gamified smartphone app for managing daily routines of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Users can experience more diverse visual rewards (e.g., village development, character acquisition) as they achieve more routines.

# <b> 3. Dataset </b>
<br/>

## <b>A dataset for the in-situ contexts where users perceive smartphone distractions</b> <a href = "https://github.com/Kaist-ICLab/positive-computing-dataset-distracting-context" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>
  * We collected in-situ user context and the corresponding smartphone distraction experiences. We implemented an mobile esm app that asks users to report their current contexts (i.e., their locations and activities) and to what extent they perceived smartphone distraction. During three weeks of the data collection session, we collected 9,180 ESM responses from 34 participants.

  * We extracted 29 features of the data from the Android smartphone application (MindScope). The data were collected from 36 participants for 27 days, four times a day. The features and data were used to predict stress levels.

## <b>User Status and Opportune Moment Dataset</b> <a href = "https://github.com/nmsl-kaist/mybutler-dataset" ><img src="github.png" alt="Github Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:35px;height:35px;" ></a>
  * This is a dataset about the opportuness of a smartphone user's status for interventions. In a one-week in-the-wild user study, 11 pairs of smartphone users used an app, called MyButler, in which each user can specify and share their current status with their partner. Their partner could choose whether to send a notification for their mobile instant message or not based on the shared status.

# <b>4. Design Guidelines for Persuasive Interaction </b> <a href = "https://twkim24.notion.site/Design-guidelines-for-persuasive-interaction-service-system-design-abf585bbd2834ccbb2ce23c897514c72" ><img src="notion.png" alt="Notion Page" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;width:40px;height:40px;" ></a><br/>
  * Guidelines cover methods, practices, and examples for designing persuasive interactions. Our recommendations are based on the research result from the Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program.
  * Guidelines consist of two parts: 1) Persuasive Interaction Design Guidelines for Stress Management 2) Guidelines for Persuasive Interaction Components and Experimentation. These guidelines may help design ICT services, test the effects of ICT services, or apply persuasive interaction components into ICT services.
