<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRecent advances of mobile and wearable technologies as well as IoT devices rapidly transform our computing environments and become de facto standards for next generation computing. This project aims to leverage persuasive interaction techniques in this novel ‘connected computing’ infrastructure for behavioral change particularly in the area of positive computing.<br/>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project is composed of two sub-parts: <br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) developing design guidelines of persuasive interaction design and its evaluation methods<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) developing a persuasive interaction platform and its foundational technologies<br/><br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwo teams will jointly build and evaluate representative services for positive computing to provide evidence-based design guidelines.

<h1><b>Purposes of this project</b></h1>
<h3>Part 1) Design guidelines of persuasive interaction and evaluation methods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exploring quantified self and contextual computing environments</li>
<li>Design guidelines based on literature review and data collection/analysis</li>
<li>Positive computing services with various intervention/engagement mechanisms</li>
<li>Developing evaluation methodologies and evidence-based design guidelines  <a href="download.html" style ="color:#0097A7;">(Download)</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Part 2) Persuasive interaction platform and its foundational technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developing platform infrastructure for data collection & contextual computing</li>
<li>Developing digital behavioral marker detection algorithms</li>
<li>Developing proper interruption moment recognition algorithms</li>
<li>Medium and content selection/configuration/delivery mechanisms</li>
<li>Positive computing service development</li>
<li>Platform component integration and open source release <a href="download.html" style ="color:#0097A7;">(Download)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1><b>Expected contributions</b></h1>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>We expect to deliver service design guidelines and user feedback at every experiment, making them reflected in service development/improvement. We expect to present our evidence-based service design guidelines to related international conferences.</li>
<br/><li>Design of new persuasive interaction services based on our design guidelines will be extended to the national intervention services by 1) providing wellbeing services to people with mild symptoms who have not been able to receive appropriate ones, 2) by overcoming the limitations of existing ineffective intervention services, and 3) by significantly reducing social costs.</li>
<br/><li>Digital behavioral marker detection and personalized interruption moment detection technologies can be directly applicable to AI-based service industry, including intelligent agents.</li>
<br/><li>Medium and content selection/configuration/delivery mechanisms.</li>
<br/><li>Our open source platform will provide foundations for R&D in various domains, including smart homes and ubiquitous healthcare. </li>
